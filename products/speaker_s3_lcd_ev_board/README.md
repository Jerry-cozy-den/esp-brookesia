# ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board Running ESP-Brookesia Phone Example

[中文版本](./README_CN.md)

This example demonstrates how to run the ESP-Brookesia Phone on the [ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32s3/esp32-s3-lcd-ev-board/index.html) with `480 x 480` and `800 x 480` resolution UI stylesheets.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

* An ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board with a `480 x 480` or `800 x 480` resolution LCD screen.

### ESP-IDF Required

- This example supports IDF release/v5.3 and later branches. By default, it runs on IDF release/v5.3.
- Please follow the [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) to set up the development environment. **We highly recommend** you [Build Your First Project](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#build-your-first-project) to get familiar with ESP-IDF and make sure the environment is set up correctly.

### Get the esp-brookesia Repository

To start from the examples in esp-brookesia, clone the repository to the local PC by running the following commands in the terminal:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-brookesia.git
```

### Configuration

Run `idf.py menuconfig` and modify the esp-brookesia configuration.

## How to Use the Example

### Build and Flash the Example

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output (replace `PORT` with your board's serial port name):

```c
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

To exit the serial monitor, type `Ctrl-]`.

See the [ESP-IDF Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
